This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Candidate-Tester – EPG Screen

This project was developed as part of the Norigin Media frontend developer test.  
It implements an **EPG (Electronic Program Guide) Screen** using the provided mock API and follows the design guidelines.


# Getting Started

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:
 
### Install and run your app

```sh
# Using npm

npm install 

npx react-native run-android

```


If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running on the Android Emulator (Mobile or TV) or on your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Key considerations

- The program depends on the device’s time, so it must always be updated.  
- The project was developed without third-party frameworks (e.g., Expo).  
- The appropriate libraries were implemented to cover the project requirements.
